# Company Portal – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

A role-based internal company portal built using React, designed to simulate real-world internal tools used by organizations.
The application provides different dashboards and permissions for Employees, Managers, and Admins using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

##  Project Overview

The focus is on:
* Practical business workflows
